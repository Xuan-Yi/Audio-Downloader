1. **Paste the youtube URLs** of the audio you'd like to download. Mind, you can paste multiple URLs with each splited by a space, as showm above.
2. **Choose the audio format** you'd like to download as. Only
    * mp3
    * wav
    * m4a
    * mp4

    are available now, since they're most used in common life.
3. The audios would be stored in the folder **Audio Storage**, wich is at the same layer of **Audio Downloader.exe**. If some error occur, the error message will be written in **Err_Msg.txt**.
    ```
    Audio Downloader
        |-  Audio Downloader.exe
        |-  Audio Storage
            |-  (Err_Msg.txt)
            |-  <Your Audios>
    ```
## Get ffmpeg
* Mac (use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/))
    ```
    brew install ffmpeg
    ```
* Linux (using aptitude):
    ```
    apt-get install ffmpeg libavcodec-extra
    ```
* Windows 
    1. Download and unzip [*youtbe-dl*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GLcJpqDi5DKNwHTfJU4EpfcLbmd6kK5K/view?usp=sharing), which is a folder including **ffmpeg.exe** and **youtube-dl.exe**. Actually, *youtube-dl.exe* is not necessary, but you can access youtube-dl in your consoles if you don't delete *youtbe-dl.exe*.
    2. Then add path of folder *youtube-dl*, that is, `XX\youtube-dl` to PATH.
